"""Custom PaymentEntry override for egypt-cheques.

Issue 1 – Party account currency: ERPNext raises an error when the selected
receivable/payable account has a different currency than the party's existing
GL entries.  The validation is performed inside
``erpnext.accounts.doctype.gl_entry.gl_entry.GLEntry.validate_currency()``
which calls ``erpnext.accounts.party.validate_party_gle_currency``.

We override ``PaymentEntry.validate`` and ``PaymentEntry.on_submit`` to
temporarily replace that function with a no-op so that Payment Entries can be
saved/submitted even when the chosen account currency differs from historical GL
entries.  The GL entries themselves are still created correctly; only the
currency-mismatch check is bypassed.

Issue 2 – Same-currency exchange rate: when ``paid_from_account_currency`` and
``paid_to_account_currency`` are the same we ensure ``received_amount`` is
always equal to ``paid_amount`` and both exchange rates are kept consistent.
